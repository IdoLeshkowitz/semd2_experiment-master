            We will now tell you a general important principle behind the allocation process.

        <button id="proceed-step-2-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>

    <p>
        Imagine the computer determined some prize priorities and rankings of the other, computerized participants. <br>
        In the allocation process, the computer will use these prize priorities and other participants’ rankings
        to determine some group of <b>Obtainable Prizes</b> that you might receive.
        <ul>
            <li>These Obtainable Prizes might include some or all of the prizes. There will always be at least one Obtainable Prize. </li>
            <li>Importantly, <b>you cannot affect the Obtainable Prizes with your own ranking</b>.
                They are only determined using the other participants' rankings and the prize priorities.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>

<section id="step-3">
    <div class="explain">
    <p>
        Then:
        <ul>
            <li>You always get the Obtainable Prize that is ranked highest in the ranking you submitted.</li>
            <li>In other words, no ranking would get you a non-Obtainable Prize, and among the Obtainable Prizes,
                you get the one that you ranked highest.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-4-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>

<section id="step-4">
    <div class="explain">
    <p>
        For example, imagine that your Obtainable Prizes are B and D. If you submit the ranking A–B–C–D (from most to least preferred),
        you will get Prize B, which is the one you ranked highest among the Obtainable Prizes.
        No ranking you could possibly submit would get you Prize A or Prize C, since the Obtainable Prizes are B and D.
