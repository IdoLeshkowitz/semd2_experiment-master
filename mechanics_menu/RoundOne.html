        The training round is not yet over. To complete it, you will perform the allocation process by yourself, instead of the computer. <br><br>
        First, we will guide you how to use the <b>Allocation Dashboard</b> below to find the temporary allocation of prizes to all participants except for you:
        <br><br>
        <div class="btn-container">
            <button id="proceed-step-2-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Proceed</button>
        </div>
        <br>
    </section>
    <section id="step-2">
        On the upper left part of the dashboard below you see the <b>Participant Rankings</b>.<br>
        Each letter under a participant name indicates one of the four prizes. The higher it is placed in the column, the higher that prize was ranked by that participant.<br><br>
        <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“R”</b> indicates the ranking submitted by the computerized participant Ruth. She ranked Prize A <b>(“A”)</b> first (highest), Prize C <b>(“C”)</b> second, Prize D <b>(“D”)</b> third, and Prize B <b>(“B”)</b> fourth (lowest). <br>
        Notice that the ranking under “Y” (you) is exactly the ranking that you submitted in the previous screen! <br><br>
        On the upper right part of the dashboard below you see the <b>Prize Priorities</b>.<br><br>
        Each letter under a prize name indicates one of the four participants. The higher it is placed in the column, the higher the priority of that participant at that prize. <br><br>
        <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“A”</b> indicates the priorities of Prize A. Ruth <b>(“R”)</b> has the first (highest) priority at that prize, Shirley <b>(“S”)</b> has the second priority, Theresa <b>(“T”)</b> has the third priority, and you <b>(“Y”)</b> have the fourth (lowest) priority. <br><br>

        Also Notice: Since you are now in charge of the allocation process, and you have to use the other participants’ rankings to perform it, <b>in these training rounds only</b> you are able to see the other participants’ rankings.<br><br>

        The middle and lower parts of the dashboard enable you to pair prizes to participants, as will be explained next.
        <br><br>
        <div class="btn-container">
            <button id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Proceed</button>

        <br>
    </section>
    <section id="step-3">
        First, pair each prize to its <b>highest-priority</b> participant.<br><br>

        Start by clicking on <b>Prize A (“A”)</b> to the right of “Unpaired prizes”.
        Then, in the list of four participants at the bottom of the dashboard, click on “+” next to the participant, <b>except for you</b> that is highest in their priorities.<br>
        <p>Hint: this participant is indicated by the letter just under “A” in the Prize Priorities table.</p>
        <p>After pairing, “R” will be colored purple under Prize A’s name (“A”) and “A” will be colored purple under Ruth’s name (“R”) , to help you keep track that they are paired.</p>
        <p>Notice: There is no “+” sign next to “You” in the bottom part of the dashboard, reminding that you should not pair any prize with yourself during this stage of the allocation process.</p>
        <p>Click Submit when done.</p>
