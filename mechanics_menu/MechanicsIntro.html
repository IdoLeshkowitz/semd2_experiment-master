         You will now learn the full technical details of the allocation process.
      </p>
      <p>
         The allocation process begins with a multi-step  process which does <b>not</b> involve
         your own submitted ranking, as follows:
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="btn-container">
      <button id="proceed-step-2-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
   </div>
</section>
<section id="step-2">
   <div class="explain_mech">
      <p>
         In the first step, each prize is paired to its <b>highest-priority</b> participant,
         among all participants <b>except for you</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
         To solve the conflict, only the prize with the highest
         rank at that participant’s ranking remains paired to that participant. The others get unpaired.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="btn-container">
      <button id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container" >Proceed</button>
   </div>
</section>
<section id="step-3">
   <div class="explain_mech">
      <p>
         In the next step, possible conflicts are detected and solved.
      </p>
      <p>
         If two (or more) prizes are paired to the same
         participant, this is a <b>conflict</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="indent_all">
         Each conflict is solved in two steps:</br>
      <ul>
      <li><b> Unpair:</b> only the prize with the highest rank at that participant’s ranking remains paired to
         that participant. The others get unpaired.<br/>
      </li>
      <li><b> Re-pair:</b> all unpaired prizes can only get re-paired to participants
         that they were not paired with before. Each unpaired prize is re-paired to
         its highest-priority participant, among the participants they
         <b>were not yet paired with and except for you.</b>
      </li>
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="btn-container">
      <button id="proceed-step-4-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container" >Proceed</button>
   </div>
</section>
<section id="step-4">
   <div class="explain_mech">
      <p>
         Later steps continue in the same way, by detecting and solving new conflicts.
         </br></br>
         Like before, if two (or more) prizes are paired to the same participant, this is a conflict.
      </p>
      <p class="indent_all">
      <ul>
         Like before, each conflict is solved in two steps:</br>
         <li><b> Unpair:</b> only the prize with the highest rank at that participant’s
            ranking remains paired to that participant. The others get unpaired, <b>even if they successfully
            got paired to that participant in the first step.</b> </br>
         </li>
         <li><b> Re-pair:</b> Every unpaired prize get re-paired to its highest-priority
            participant, among the participants they  <b>were not previously paired with and except for you.</b>

      <p>
         During the process, one prize will encounter a conflict with each participant, except for you, and will get unpaired from all of them. That prize will remain unpaired at the end of the process.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="btn-container">
      <button id="proceed-step-6-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container" >Proceed</button>

<section id="step-6">
   <div class="explain">
      <p>
         When there are no more conflicts and when one prize was unpaired from all participants, the process is over.
         The result is each prize, except for the unpaired one, being paired to a different participant, except for you.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each prize except for the unpaired one is then temporarily allocated to the participant it is paired to.
