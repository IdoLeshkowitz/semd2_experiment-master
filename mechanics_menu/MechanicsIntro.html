        <p>
            The allocation process is a multi-step process which <b>does not involve your own submitted ranking</b>, as follows:
                <p>
                In the first step, each participant prize is paired to their its <b>highest</b>-rank -priority prize participant, among all participants <b>except for you.</b>
                </p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button class="btn btn-primary btn-container" id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button">Proceed</button>

<section id="step-3">
    <div class="explain">
        <p>
                In the next step, possible conflicts are detected and solved.<br/>
                If two (or more) participants prizes are paired to the same prize participant, this is a <b>conflict.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           <b>Unpair:</b> only the prize highest in that participant’s ranking  remains paired to that participant. The others get unpaired.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Re-pair:</b> all unpaired prizes can only get re-paired to participants that they were not paired with before. Each unpaired prize is re-paired to its <b>highest</b>-priority participant, among the participants they <b>were not yet paired with</b> and <b>except for you.</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            Later steps continue in the same way, by detecting and solving new conflicts.<br/>
            Like before, if two (or more) prizes are paired to the same participant, this is a <b>conflict.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Unpair:</b> only the prize highest in that participant’s ranking remains paired to that participant. The others get unpaired, <b>even if they successfully got paired to that participant in a previous step.</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Re-pair:</b> Every unpaired prize gets re-paired to its highest-priority participant, among the participants they <b>were not previously paired with</b> and <b>except for you.</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
        </p>
       <p>
           There is one <b>exception</b> to the Re-pair step:<br/>
            During the process, one prize will encounter a conflict with <b>every</b> participant, except for you, and will eventually get unpaired from all of them. That prize will <b>remain unpaired</b> at the end of the process.
       </p>

<section id="step-5">
    <div class="explain">
        <p>
            When there are no more conflicts and when one prize was unpaired from all participants (except for you), the process is over. The result is each prize, except for the unpaired one, being paired to a different participant, except for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each prize except for the unpaired one is then <b>temporarily allocated</b> to the participant it is paired to.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this temporary allocation, no prize was allocated to you. To determine which prize is allocated to you, the computer first determines which prizes you can obtain in principle. These are the <b>Obtainable Prizes.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can obtain two kinds of prizes:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Any prize that your priority of getting is higher</b> than that of the participant it is temporarily allocated to.</li>
                <li><b>The prize that was left unpaired in the temporary allocation.</b> You cannot obtain any other prizes.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end, among the Obtainable Prizes, you get the one that you ranked the <b>highest.</b>
