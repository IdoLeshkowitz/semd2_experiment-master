            <p>In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa,
              are playing rounds of a game for four prizes. <br>
              Each prize is worth money, but is worth a different amount of money for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>In each round, you and the computerized participants each rank the four prizes from most preferred to least preferred.<br>
            Then, an <b>allocation process</b> uses these rankings to allocate the prizes—one prize for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather
                than a prize that they ranked lower, while taking into account the rankings of all participants.
