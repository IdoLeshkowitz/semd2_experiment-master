                In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa, are going to play a game for four prizes.<br/>
                Each prize is worth money, but might be worth a different amount of money for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and the computerized participants will each rank the four prizes in any order you wish.<br/>
                Then, an <b>allocation process</b> will use these rankings to allocate the prizesâ€”one prize for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather than a prize that they ranked lower, while taking into account the rankings of all participants.
