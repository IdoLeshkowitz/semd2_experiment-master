        <p>
            In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa, are going to play a game for four prizes.
            Each prize is worth money, but is worth a different amount of money for each participant.
        </p>

        <p>
            You and the computerized participants will each rank the 4 prizes from most preferred to least preferred.
            Then, an <b>allocation process</b> will use these rankings to allocate the prizes — one prize for each participant.
        </p>

        <p>
            The allocation process will try to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather than a prize that they ranked lower,
            while taking into account the rankings of all participants.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn about the game and allocation process while playing a round of the game.
            This text provides explanations of the game interface. <b>Make sure you read it carefully</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A round of the game has three steps.
        </p>

    <section id="step-1">
        <h4>Step 1: Round Information</h4>

        <div class="explain">
            <p>
                In Step 1, you first see the <b>prizes</b> you can get in this round.
                Each prize is worth money, but might be worth a different amount of money for each participant.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In this round, the <b>prizes</b> are:
        </p>

        <table id="prize-table" class=" table table-bordered">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Prize</th>
                    <th>A</th>
                    <th>B</th>
                    <th>C</th>
                    <th>D</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
        </table>
       
        <div class="explain">
            <p>
                In the table above, under each prize A, B, C or D, you can see how much money it would add to <b>your</b> earnings.
                The computerized participants <b>do not know</b> the money amounts shown in your table, and the allocation process is not affected by these money amounts.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Next, you see what we call the <b>prize priorities</b>:
            </p>

            <p>
                All four participants have some <p>priority</p> at each of the four prizes. These priorities can affect the allocation of prizes.
                The higher your priority is at some prize, the more likely you are to get that prize at the end of the process.                
            </p>
        </div>
       
        <p>
            In this round, the <b>prize priorities</b> for you and for the other participants are:
        </p>

        <table id="priorities-table" class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Prize A</th>
                    <th>Prize B</th>
                    <th>Prize C</th>
                    <th>Prize D</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
        </table>

        <div class="explain">
            <p>
                Each column shows the priorities of all participants at some prize, written from highest to lowest.
                For example, the column under <b>Prize A</b> shows its priorities. Prize A has Ruth in the 1st priority (the highest),
                Shirley in the 2nd priority, You in the 3rd priority and Theresa in the 4th priority (the lowest).
                So, for example, it is easier for Ruth to get Prize A this round, and harder for Theresa to get Prize A this round.
            </p>

            <p>
                The prize-priorities table is chosen <b>completely at random</b>, with each possible table being equally likely.
                You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the prize priorities</b>.
