    <div class="explain">
        <p>
            You will now learn the full technical details of the allocation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The allocation process is a multi-step process, as follows:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-2-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="step-2">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p class="indent">
            In the first step, each participant is paired to thier <b>highest-rank</b> prize.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            If two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, there is a <b>conflict</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            To solve the conflict, only the participant with the highest
            priority at that prize remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container" >Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="step-3">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p class="indent">
            In the second step, all unpaired participants can only get paired to prizes
            that they were not paired with before.
        </p>
         <p class="indent">
            Each unpaired participant is paired to thier highest-rank prize, among the prizes they <b>were not yet paired
            with</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Like before, if two (or more) participants are paired to the same
            prize as a result, there is a <b>conflict</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            To solve the conflict, only the participant with the highest priority at that prize
            remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired, <b>even if they
            successfully got paired to that prize in the first step.</b>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-4-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container" >Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="step-4">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p class="indent">
            Later steps continue in the same way. Each step, every unpaired participant is paired
            to thier highest-rank prize, among the prizes they
            <b>were not previously paired with</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            If there are conflicts, only the participant with the highest priority at a prize remains
            paired to that prize and the others get unpaired, including paired participants from previous steps.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-5-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="step-5">
    <div class="explain">
        <p>
            When there are no more conflicts, the process is over. The result is each participant, being paired to a different prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each prize is then allocated to the
            participant paired to it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-6-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
