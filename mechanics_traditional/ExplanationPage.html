            You will now learn the full technical details of the allocation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The allocation process is a multi-step process, as follows:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-2-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="step-2">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p>
            In the first step, each participant is paired to their <b>highest-rank</b> prize.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-3-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="step-3">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p>
            In the next step, possible conflicts are detected and solved.
            </br></br>
            If two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a conflict.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p class="indent_all">
            Each conflict is solved in two steps:</br>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Unpair:</b> only the participant with the highest priority at that prize remains paired to
                                that prize. The others get unpaired.<br/>
            </li>
            <li><b> Re-pair:</b> all unpaired participants can only get re-paired to prizes
                                 that they were not paired with before. Each unpaired participant is re-paired to
                                 its highest-rank prize, among the prizes they <b>were not yet paired with.</b>
            </li>
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-4-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="step-4">
    <div class="explain_mech">
        <p>
            Later steps continue in the same way, by detecting and solving new conflicts.
            </br></br>
            Like before, if two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a conflict.
        </p>
        <p class="indent_all">
        <ul>
            Like before, each conflict is solved in two steps:</br>
            <li><b> Unpair:</b> only the participant with the highest priority at that prize
                                remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired, <b>even if they successfully
                                                                                          got paired to that prize in
                                                                                          the first step.</b> </br>
            </li>
            <li><b> Re-pair:</b> Every unpaired participant get re-paired to their highest-rank
                                 prize, among the prizes they <b>were not previously paired with.</b>

        <p>
            When there are no more conflicts, the process is over. The result is each participant, being paired to a
            different prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each prize is then allocated to the participant paired to it.
