        The training round is not yet over. To complete it, you will perform the allocation process by yourself, instead of the computer. <br><br>
        We will guide you how to use the <b>Allocation Dashboard</b> below to find the allocation of prizes to all participants
        <br><br>
        <div class="btn-container">

    <section id="step-2">
        On the upper left part of the dashboard below you see the condensed version of the <b>Prize Priorities</b> that you saw before.<br>
        Each letter under a participant name indicates one of the four prizes. The higher it is placed in the column, the higher that prize was ranked by that participant.<br><br>
        <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“R”</b> indicates the ranking submitted by the computerized participant Ruth. She ranked Prize A <b>(“A”)</b> first (highest), Prize C <b>(“C”)</b> second, Prize D <b>(“D”)</b> third, and Prize B <b>(“B”)</b> fourth (lowest). <br>
        Notice that the ranking under “Y” (you) is exactly the ranking that you submitted in the previous screen! <br><br>
        On the upper right part of the dashboard below you see the <b>Prize Priorities</b>.<br><br>
        Each letter under a prize name indicates one of the four participants. The higher it is placed in the column, the higher the priority of that participant at that prize. <br><br>
        <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“A”</b> indicates the priorities of Prize A. Ruth <b>(“R”)</b> has the first (highest) priority for getting that prize, Shirley <b>(“S”)</b> has the second priority, Theresa <b>(“T”)</b> has the third priority, and you <b>(“Y”)</b> have the fourth (lowest) priority. <br><br>

        Also Notice: Since you are now in charge of the allocation process, and you have to use the other participants’ rankings to perform it, <b>in these training rounds only</b> you are able to see the other participants’ rankings.<br><br>

        The middle and lower parts of the dashboard enable you to pair participants to prizes, as will be explained next.

        2. Then, in the list of four participants at the bottom of the dashboard, click on “+” next to the participant, <b>except for you</b> that is highest in their priorities.<br>
        <p>Hint: the prize that is highest in Ruth’s ranking is indicated by the letter just under “R” in the Participant Rankings table.</p>
        <p>After pairing, “A” and “R” will be colored purple in the two tables, to indicate that they are paired.</p>
