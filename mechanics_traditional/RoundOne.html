        The training round is not yet over. To complete it, you will perform the allocation process by yourself, instead of the computer.

            On the upper left part of the dashboard below you see a condensed version of the <b>Prize Priorities</b> that you saw before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each letter under a prize name indicates one of the four participants. The higher it is placed in the column, the higher the priority of that participant at that prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“A”</b> indicates the priorities of Prize A. Ruth <b>(“R”)</b> has the first (highest) priority for getting that prize, Shirley <b>(“S”)</b> has the second priority, Theresa <b>(“T”)</b> has the third priority, and you <b>(“Y”)</b> have the fourth (lowest) priority.

            <b>For example:</b> The column under the letter <b>“R”</b> indicates the ranking submitted by the computerized participant Ruth. She ranked Prize A <b>(“A”)</b> first (highest), Prize C <b>(“C”)</b> second, Prize D <b>(“D”)</b> third, and Prize B <b>(“B”)</b> fourth (lowest).<br/>
            Notice that the ranking under “Y” (you) is exactly the ranking that you submitted in the previous screen!
