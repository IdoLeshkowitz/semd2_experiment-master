            The allocation process is a multi-step process, as follows:
                <p>
                In the first step, each participant is paired to their <b>highest</b>-rank prize.
                </p>
        </p>

    <div class="btn-container">

                In the next step, possible conflicts are detected and solved.<br/>
                If two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a <b>conflict</b>.<br/>
                Each conflict is solved in two steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           <b>Unpair</b>: only the participant highest in that prize’s priorities remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Re-pair</b>: all unpaired participants can only get re-paired to prizes that they were not paired with before. Each unpaired participant is re-paired to their <b>highest-rank</b> prize among the prizes they <b>were not yet paired with</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Later steps continue in the same way, by detecting and solving new conflicts.<br/>
                    Like before, if two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a <b>conflict</b>.<br/>
                    Like before, each conflict is solved in two steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Unpair</b>: only the participant highest in that prize’s priorities remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired, <b>even if they successfully got paired to that prize in a previous step</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Re-pair</b>: Every unpaired participant gets re-paired to their highest-rank prize among the prizes they <b>were not previously paired with</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

        <p>
            When there are no more conflicts, the process is over. The result is each participant being paired to a different prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each prize is then allocated to the participant paired to it.
