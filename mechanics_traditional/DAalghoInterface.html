                      The allocation process is a multi-step process , as follows:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                      In the first step, each participant is paired to their <b>highest</b>-rank prize.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>
                              In the next step, possible conflicts are detected and solved. If two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a <b>conflict</b>.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Each conflict is solved in two steps:
                              <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Unpair:</b> only the participant highest in that prize’s priorities remains paired to that prize. The others get unpaired.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Re-pair:</b> all unpaired participants can only get re-paired to prizes that they were not paired with before. Each unpaired participant is re-paired to their <b>highest-rank</b> prize among the prizes they <b>were not yet paired with</b>.
                                    </li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>
                              Later steps continue in the same way, by detecting and solving new conflicts.<br/>
                              Like before, if two (or more) participants are paired to the same prize, this is a <b>conflict</b>.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Like before, each conflict is solved in two steps:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Unpair:</b> only the participant highest in that prize’s priorities remains paired to that prize . The others get unpaired, <b>even if they successfully got paired to that prize in a previous step</b>.
                                </li>
                                  <li>
                                      <b>Re-pair:</b> Every unpaired participant gets re-paired to their highest-rank prize among the prizes they <b>were not previously paired with</b>.
                                  </li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                      </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                      When there are no more conflicts, the process is over. The result is each participant being paired to a different prize.
                  </p><br/>
                  <p>
                      Each prize is then <b>allocated</b> to the participant paired to it.
                  </p>
