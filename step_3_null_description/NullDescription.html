            In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa, are going to play a game for four prizes.
            Each prize is worth money, but is worth a different amount of money for each participant.
        </p>
        <p>
            You and the computerized participants will each rank the four prizes from most preferred to least preferred. <br>
            Then, an <b>allocation process</b> will use these rankings to allocate the prizes — one prize for each participant.

            The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather than a prize that they ranked lower,
            while taking into account the rankings of all participants.

        <p>
            You will learn about the game and allocation process while playing a round of the game.

            In the table above, under each prize A, B, C or D, you can see how much money it would add to <b>your</b> earnings.

        <p>
            The money amounts shown in your table can be different in different rounds of the game, and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. <br>
            You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the money amounts</b> shown in your table.

            All four participants have some <b>priority</b> at each of the four prizes.

        <p>
            These priorities can affect the allocation of prizes. <br>

            Each column shows the priorities of all participants at some prize, written from highest to lowest. <br>
            For example, the column under <b>Prize A</b> shows its priorities. Prize A has Ruth in the 1st priority (the highest),
            Shirley in the 2nd priority, You in the 3rd priority and Theresa in the 4th priority (the lowest).
            So, for example, it is easier for Ruth to get Prize A this round, and harder for Theresa to get Prize A this round.
