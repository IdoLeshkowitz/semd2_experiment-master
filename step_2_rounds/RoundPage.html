            <p>In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa,
              are playing rounds of a game for four prizes. <br>
              Each prize is worth money, but is worth a different amount of money for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>In each round, you and the computerized participants each rank the four prizes from most preferred to least preferred.<br>
            Then, an <b>allocation process</b> uses these rankings to allocate the prizes—one prize for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather
                than a prize that they ranked lower, while taking into account the rankings of all participants.

            <p>In Step 1, you first see the <b>prizes</b> you can get in this round.
                Each prize is worth money, but might be worth a different amount of money for each participant. </p>
            <p>In the table, under each prize A, B, C or D, you can see how much money it would add to <b>your</b> earnings.</p>
            <p>The money amounts shown in your table can be different in different rounds of the game,
                and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. <br>

            <p>All four participants have some <b>priority</b> at each of the four prizes. <br>
             These priorities can affect the allocation of prizes. </p>
            <p>The higher your priority is at some prize, the more likely you are to get that prize at the end of the process.</p>
            <p>Each column shows the priorities of all participants at some prize, written from highest to lowest.
              For example, the column under <b>Prize A</b> shows its priorities.
              Prize A has Ruth in the 1st priority (the highest),
              Shirley in the 2nd priority, You in the 3rd priority and Theresa in the 4th priority (the lowest).
              So, for example, it is easier for Ruth to get Prize A this round, and harder for Theresa to get Prize A this round.</p>
            <p>The prize priorities can be different in different rounds of the game,
                and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. <br>
