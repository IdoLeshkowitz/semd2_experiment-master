    <p>This study takes around 60 minutes to complete. Everything you will earn in the study is actual money.</p>
    <p>In this study you will learn about a game, and play the game.</p>
    <p>For completing the study, you will earn <b>{{ 16 | cu }}</b>. However, your total earnings can increase by <b>additional {{ 16 | cu }}</b> (up to a total of <b>{{ 32 | cu }}</b>) in two ways:</p>
    1. <b>Earnings from playing</b>, which are no less than <b>{{ 1 | cu }}</b> and can be up to <b>{{ 12 | cu }}</b>: You will play a lot of rounds of the game, and each round earns you money, as you will learn shortly.<br/>Make sure you play the game thoughtfully!<br/><br/>
    2. An <b>Understanding Bonus</b>, which can be up to <b>{{ 4 | cu}}</b>: You will learn about the game in different parts of this study and we will ask you a lot of understanding questions. At the end of the study, each question you answer correctly on the <b>first attempt</b> will be counted for an Understanding Bonus.<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you answered all questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn the full Understanding Bonus of {{ 4 | cu }}.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you answered some fraction of the questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn this fraction of the Understanding Bonus. For example, if you answered 80% of the questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn 80% times {{ 4 | cu }} = {{ 3.20 | cu }}.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will <b>not</b> earn money for questions that you only answered correctly after more than one attempt, unless stated otherwise.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure you pay close attention to the game instructions to earn this money!</p>
    <p>You can always see your total earnings so far in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
