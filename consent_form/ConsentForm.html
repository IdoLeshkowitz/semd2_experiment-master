    <p>This study takes around <b>70 minutes</b> to complete. Everything you will earn in the study is actual money.</p>
    <p>Please <b>use Google Chrome</b> and <b>maximize the browserâ€™s window</b> on your screen to view the study properly.<br/>
    <p>In this study you will learn about a game, and play the game.</p>
    <p>For completing the study, you will earn <b>{{ 7 | cu }}. </b>Your total earnings can increase in two ways:
    <ol>
    <li>
        <b>Earnings from playing</b>, which can be up to <b>{{ 9.9 | cu }}</b>: You will play a lot of rounds of the game, and each round earns you money depending on your actions and luck, as you will learn shortly. Make sure you play the game thoughtfully!
    </li>
    <li>
        An <b>Understanding Bonus</b>, which can be up to <b>{{ 4.5 | cu}}</b>: You will learn about the game in different parts of this study and we will ask you many understanding questions. At the end of the study, each question you answer correctly on the <b>first attempt</b> will be counted for your Understanding Bonus.<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you answered all questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn the full Understanding Bonus of {{ 4.5 | cu }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you answered some fraction of the questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn this fraction of the Understanding Bonus. For example, if you answered 80% of the questions correctly on the first attempt, you will earn 80% times {{ 4.5 | cu }} = {{ 3.6 | cu }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unless stated otherwise, you will <b>not</b> earn money for questions that you only answered correctly after more than one attempt.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Make sure you pay close attention to the game instructions to earn this money!

            <b>It is crucial for our purposes that you complete the study</b> once you start it. Making some mistakes in understanding questions along the way is perfectly normal. Our main objective is that you try your best to understand and play the game.

        Important notes:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not worry about rejection. We will <b>not reject your submission</b> if you do not answer understanding questions correctly. Instead, your Understanding Bonus will increase the more questions you answer correctly, and your earnings from playing the game depend on your understanding of it.</li>
            <li>Remember that every question you are asked or a game round you play is a completely new opportunity to increase your earnings, regardless of your previous outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
