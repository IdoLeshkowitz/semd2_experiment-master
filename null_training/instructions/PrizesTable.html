        <p>In this round, your <b>prizes</b> are:</p>
        <table id="prize-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Prize</th>
                    <th>A</th>

                    <td class="money-amount">{{ fourthPrize | cu }}</td>
                </tr>

        </table><br/>

                    In Step 1, you first see the <b>prizes</b> you can get in this round and how much money they are worth to <b>you</b>. In the table, under each prize A, B, C or D, you can see how much money it would add to <b>your</b> earnings if <b>you get it</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each prize might be worth a <b>different</b> amount of money for each participant, and each participant can only see the money amounts relevant to <b>themselves</b>. However, the prizes that earn you a large amount of money are also likely to earn the <b>other participants</b> a large amount of money. There is more likely to be <b>competition</b> for the high-earning prizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The money worth of prizes for you and for the other participants can be different in different rounds of the game, and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the money worth of prizes</b>.
