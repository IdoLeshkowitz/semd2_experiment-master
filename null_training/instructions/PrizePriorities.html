                    All four participants have some <b>priority</b> for getting each of the four prizes.
                    These priorities can affect the allocation of prizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The higher your priority is for getting some prize, the more likely you are to get that prize at the end of the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each column shows the priorities of all participants at some prize, written from highest to lowest.
                  For example, the column under <b>Prize A</b> shows its priorities.
                  Prize A has Ruth in the 1st priority (the highest),
                  Shirley in the 2nd priority, You in the 3rd priority and Theresa in the 4th priority (the lowest).
                  So, for example, it is easier for Ruth to get Prize A this round, and harder for Theresa to get Prize A this round.
                </p>
                <p>The prize priorities can be different in different rounds of the game,
                    and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. <br>
                    You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the prize priorities</b>.
