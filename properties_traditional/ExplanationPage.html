            We will now tell you a general important principle behind the allocation process.

            Imagine some ordered list of prizes written from top to bottom, to which we will later refer to as “the
            list”. <br>
            Consider two possible scenarios: <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">(1) Submitting a ranking that follows the order of prizes in the list.<br>
                                      (2) Submitting any different, alternative ranking.</p>

        Imagine the computer determined some prize priorities and rankings of the other, computerized participants.
        These are the same in the two scenarios.

<section id="step-3">

        <p>
            Then:
        <ul>
            <li>The prize you get in scenario (1) is always <b>at least as high on the list</b> as the prize you get in
                scenario (2).
            </li>
            <li>In other words, the prize you get in scenario (2) can either be <b>the same</b> as in scenario (1),
                or some prize even <b>lower on the list</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <button id="proceed-step-4-btn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-container">Proceed</button>
    </div>

<section id="step-4">
    <div class="explain">
        <p>
            For example, imagine that in scenario (1) you submitted the ranking A–B–C–D (from most to least preferred)
            and ended up getting Prize C.
            Submitting any other, alternative ranking in scenario (2) could have only gotten you Prize C or Prize D.
            No other, alternative ranking in scenario (2) could have gotten you Prize A or Prize B.
