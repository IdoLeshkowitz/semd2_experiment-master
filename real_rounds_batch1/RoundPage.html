                In this study, you and three computerized participants, Ruth, Shirley, and Theresa, are going to play a game for four prizes.<br/>
                Each prize is worth money, but might be worth a different amount of money for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and the computerized participants will each rank the four prizes in any order you wish.<br/>
                Then, an <b>allocation process</b> will use these rankings to allocate the prizes—one prize for each participant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather than a prize that they ranked lower, while taking into account the rankings of all participants.

    <h4>Step 1: Round Information</h4>
    <p>
        In this round, your <b>prizes</b> are:
    </p>
    <table id="prize-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Prize</th>

                <td class="money-amount">{{ fourth_prize | cu }}</td>

            <p>
                In Step 1, you first see the <b>prizes</b> you can get in this round and how much money they are worth to <b>you</b>. In the table, under each prize A, B, C or D, you can see how much money it would add to <b>your</b> earnings if <b>you get it</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each prize might be worth a <b>different</b> amount of money for each participant, and each participant can only see the money amounts relevant to <b>themselves</b>. However, the prizes that earn you a large amount of money are also likely to earn the <b>other participants</b> a large amount of money. There is more likely to be <b>competition</b> for the high-earning prizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The money worth of prizes for you and for the other participants can be different in different rounds of the game, and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the money worth of prizes</b>.

            <p>
                All four participants have some <b>priority</b> for getting each of the four prizes.
                These priorities can affect the allocation of prizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The higher your priority is for getting some prize, the more likely you are to get that prize at the end of the process.
            </p>
            <p>Each column shows the priorities of all participants at some prize, written from highest to lowest.
              For example, the column under <b>Prize A</b> shows its priorities.
              Prize A has Ruth in the 1st priority (the highest),
              Shirley in the 2nd priority, You in the 3rd priority and Theresa in the 4th priority (the lowest).
              So, for example, it is easier for Ruth to get Prize A this round, and harder for Theresa to get Prize A this round.</p>
            <p>The prize priorities can be different in different rounds of the game,
                and they were <b>determined beforehand</b>. <br>
                You and the other participants <b>cannot affect the prize priorities</b>.</p>
