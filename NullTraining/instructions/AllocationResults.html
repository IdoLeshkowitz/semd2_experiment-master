                    The allocation process tries to give each participant a prize that they ranked higher rather than a prize that they ranked lower,
                    while taking into account the rankings of all participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prize priorities can affect the allocation of prizes. <br>
                    The higher your priority is at some prize, the more likely you are to get that prize at the end of the process.
